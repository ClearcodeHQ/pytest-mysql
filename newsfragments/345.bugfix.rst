Raise exception with helpful message if unixsocket is too long on FreeBSD or MacOS system

OSX gives out super long temp directories.  This isn't a problem until
we run into an odd 103-character limit on the names of unix sockets
`see this stackoverflow thread <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/367008/why-is-socket-path-length-limited-to-a-hundred-chars/367012#367012>`_.
Here we warn and give the user a way out of it.
